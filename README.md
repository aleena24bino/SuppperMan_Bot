### Project Description
This Telegram bot helps users identify and manage inactive groups. When enabled in a group, it monitors activity and lists inactive groups to the user. The user can then choose to keep or delete the group, with guided instructions for deletion.

### The Problem statement
Many users are part of multiple Telegram groups that become inactive over time, cluttering their chats. Manually identifying and leaving such groups is time-consuming.

### The Solution
This bot automates the process by:
  * Tracking group inactivity.
  * Listing inactive groups for the user.
  * Providing options to keep or delete them.
  * Resetting the timer if the group is kept.
  * Providing deletion instructions and links if the group is to be removed.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python (for the bot logic)

For Hardware:

### Implementation
For Software:
- The bot is developed using Python and interacts with the Telegram Bot API.
- Users initiate the bot with /start.
- When inactivity is detected, the bot notifies users with keep/delete options.
